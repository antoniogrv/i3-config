# i3wm

This repository holds some basic configuration for the i3 tiling window manager.

**Important**. Please note that when using multiple monitors, you should probably configure the displays with `xrandr`. Chances are that without prior configuration, your monitor won't be *on the right place* when moving around windows. Alternatively, you could a GUI-based display configuration software such as `arandr`.

Please consult the [i3wm user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) for more information.
