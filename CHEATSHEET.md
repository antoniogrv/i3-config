`MOD + Enter` - Opens a new window.

`MOD + d` - Opens an application launcher.
`MOD + 0..9` - Switches to workspace `1..9`.
`MOD + Shift + 0..9` - Moves the current window to workspace `0..9`. Note that workspace `0` would be workspace `10` on the status bar.
`MOD + Shift + Arrow Keys` - Moves the current window in a specific direction.
`MOD + r` - Enters *resize mode*. You can resize the current window by using the *Arrow Keys* **without the MOD leader**.

`MOD + h` - Next window will spawn horizontally, i.e. *on the side*. This is the default behaviour.
